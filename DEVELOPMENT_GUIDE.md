# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

- Docker (See `bin/docker_install.sh` for installation)
- Docker Compose (v1.29.2+)
- Optional: `hasura-cli` for database migrations

## :whale: Docker Commands

- `docker compose up -d` - Start dev environment
- `docker compose stop` - Stop environment, keep data
- `docker compose start` Start environment after stop
- `docker compose down -v` Bring down environment and delete all containers and volumes
- `docker ps -a` - Get container names
- `docker exec -it container_name /bin/sh` - Run a shell inside a given container
- `docker compose logs -f` - Show all logs
- `docker logs container_name -f` - Show logs of a given container

## üå± Seeds

Seed data is a set of data used to initialize the database with an initial set of values. It is especially useful during development and testing.

### Default User Seeds
The seed data includes the following users:

- `admin@example.com`
- `student1@example.com` through `student5@example.com`
- `expert1@example.com` through `expert5@example.com`

The password for all users is `dev`.  

### Managing Seed Data

There are two ways to manage seed data:

1. **Temporary Changes**: Use the Hasura console to make temporary changes during development.

2. **Permanent Changes**: 
   - The initial database state is defined in `backend/seeds/default/initial_seeds.sql`
   - This file is automatically applied when starting a fresh database

### Exporting Current Data as Seeds

You can export the current database state as a seed file using the provided script:

```bash
# Navigate to the seeds/utils directory
cd backend/seeds/utils

# Make the script executable (first time only)
chmod +x export_seeds.sh

# Run the export script
./export_seeds.sh
```

This will create a `initial_seeds.sql` file in the `backend/seeds/default/` directory. This file contains the current state of all tables in the database.

The new initial state will be applied to fresh database installations

## :wrench: Useful Scripts

- `regenerate-apollo.sh` - This script rebuilds Apollo GraphQL queries. It is useful when you have made changes to your GraphQL schema and you want to generate new types and queries based on the updated schema.

  - Call it as follows from the folder of the repo (Hasura must be running): `sudo bash regenerate-apollo.sh $USER`. It will handle running the `apollo:codegen` target and then fix the problem that generated files are generated as owned by root on your host machine. This way you will be able to push/pull the files using git without access violation errors. The containers need to be up for this. Hotreloading during development should pick up the changes, though I would not be surprised if in some situations a stop/start of the containers will be required to stabilize the setup after all those files are deleted and replaced.

- `docker_install.sh` - This script installs Docker. It is useful when setting up a new development environment.

## üìù Naming Conventions

- Branches: <issue_label>/issue<issue_no>/<sanitized_issue_title>
  - Example: bug/issue123/fixLoginError
  - We recommend using the GitHub extension to create new branches and copying the `post-checkout` script provided in the folder `.githooks` in the folder `.git/hooks/`. Branch created and checked-out via the issues provides in the GitHub extension will then automatically be named according to the convention.

- Translations:
  - all keys use snake_case (Example: `login_error_message`)
  - for each page, there is a separate file in the `i18n` folder; the file name is the same as the page name but in hyphen-case (Example: `course-page.json`)

- Queries:
  - Use PascalCase for the overall query name.
  - Start with the main entity or action.
  - Follow with qualifiers or specifics.
  - End with the word "Query" for clarity.
  
  Following these guidelines, here are some examples:
  - CoursesByInstructorQuery
  - UserEnrolledCoursesQuery
  - ProgramDetailQuery
  - InstructorCoursesQuery
  
  
## üß± Edu React App Structure and Component Usage
See [this document](./frontend-nx/apps/edu-hub/README.md) for a detailed explanation of the structure of the React app and how to use components.


## Ports

- `4001` - File uploads
- `8080` - Hasura API
- `5000` - Edu frontend
- `5001` - Rent-a-scientist frontend
- `28080` - Keycloak admin interface, login as **admin** with password **admin**
- `42000` to `420025` - serverless functions (currently most functions have their own port)

## Technical details

- To access the Hasura admin frontend, change to the `backend` folder and execute `hasura console`. Changes in the database schema will be saved as migrations and can be committed correspondingly.
- For implementing a new Python serverless function consider the instructions given [here](./functions/callPythonFunction/README.md).
- The hasura log is spammed by the JWK update, which happens once a second. This is correct hasura behavior for this setup.
- The serverless functions watch their own code, so if it is changed the function is automatically rebuild
- When adding new frontend apps [this bug workaround](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/9017#issuecomment-1140066503) has to be used!
- Recommended: [Manage docker as non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

## Updating the Setup

- For Keycloak settings:
To persist changes you made to the keycloak configuration export the edu-hub realm as described in [this documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/server/importExport).
  1. `docker exec -ti edu-hub_keycloak_1 /bin/sh`
  #This command opens a shell in the edu-hub_keycloak_1 container
  2. `cd bin`
  #This command changes the current directory to bin
  3. `./kc.sh export --file /opt/keycloak/data/import/edu-hub.json --users realm_file --realm edu-hub`
  #This command exports the current configuration of the edu-hub realm to a file
  4. Your local git should highlight changes in the file `./keycloak/imports-dev/edu-hub.json` now
  #This step checks if there are any changes in the configuration file

## Updating frontend-nx packages
- use `yarn upgrade-interactive` script to check for package updates
- if package version are explicitly locked in, please check for potential issues or comments while upgrading
