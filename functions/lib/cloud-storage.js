// At first I tried to emulate the google cloud storage backend using an inofficial emulator: https://github.com/oittaa/gcp-storage-emulator
// However that did not work out due to various errors the emulator produced
// Thus instead the serverless functions have two modes:

// emulated storage is for local development, it simply stores all the files inside the container and serves them as express static files

// non emulated storage is still available during production, this helper function is used to hide this decision from the serverless functions

// Storage should be from require("@google-cloud/storage")
// since this file is outside of the directory of the function it does not work to import it here
// in the future it might be worth to setup a better mechanism to share code between functions
// nx might be a good choice here, basically a monorepository for the functions with custom build process
// to produce whatever output is needed in production
